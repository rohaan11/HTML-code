       <b> Rohit Gurunath Sharma</b> (born 30 April 1987) is an Indian international cricketer who plays for Mumbai in domestic cricket and captains Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League as a right-handed batsman and an occasional right-arm off break bowler. He is the vice-captain of the Indian national team in limited-overs formats.<br>
  </br>   Sharma was first selected for the limited-overs matches on India's tour to Ireland in 2007. He made his One Day International debut against Ireland at Belfast, although he did not bat in the match.[13]

Sharma eventually made his mark on the international stage on 20 September 2007, when he led India to victory by scoring an unbeaten 50 (which came off 40 deliveries) against South Africa in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20.[14] The win reserved India a berth in the semifinals of the tournament. At one stage India were 61–4, but his partnership of 85 runs with skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni helped India to post a total of 153/5.[14] He was eventually declared Man of the Match.[14] Sharma then proceeded to score 30 runs off 16 balls in the final against Pakistan.[15]

Sharma scored his maiden ODI half-century against Pakistan, at Jaipur on 18 November 2007.[16] and was selected as part of India's 16-man squad for the 2007–08 Commonwealth Bank Series in Australia.[17] Here, he scored 235 runs at an average of 33.57 with 2 fifties,[18] including his score of 66 in the 1st final at Sydney[19] partnering Sachin Tendulkar for most of India's successful run chase. However, his ODI performances suffered a downturn after this and his middle-order position was taken over by Suresh Raina, and eventually, Virat Kohli took his position as the reserve batsman.[20]
